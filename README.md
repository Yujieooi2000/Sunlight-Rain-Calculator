# Route Path Planner Based On Sunlight and Rain Exposure

Objective:
- To provide the best route selection from one point to another point based on the usersâ€™ requirements
- To compute the exposure level of sunlight or rain along the route path

About The System:
- Use Java programming language
- Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) is implemented for the sunlight exposure computation
- A* algorithm is implemented in order to compute the route path selection
- Apply MySQL database to store the data information 

Features Of The System:
- Compute sunlight and rain exposure level based on the given requirements
- Able to select the exposure mode (Maximum or Minimum exposure level of sunlight) 
- Compute the most suitable path from one point to another point and able to print the result out
- Able to store obstacles that are able to block the sunlight and rain exposure in database for further use (Tree, Canopy, Bus Stop, etc)
